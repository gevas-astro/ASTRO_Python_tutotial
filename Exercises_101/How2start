STEP 1: Install python
Anaconda offers one of the best environments to run python.
You can find instructions here
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html

and some screenshots

look for installer version 3.8 64 bit.

STEP 2: we write a python program like you did in C++ or any other language and then run it via a terminal (Linux, Mac), or just some development environment.
You can use any text editor, but the best out there is atom:
https://atom.io/

Having said that, for most projects related to astrophysics you do not need atom or any sophisticated editor. We do most of our work in "Jupyter Notebook".
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code.

Jupyter can be installed in conda/anaconda environment via a terminal , "anaconda prompt"
https://jupyter.org/install

STEP 3: getting started
here are some read material about conda
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/

Also for programming in python I have some notes and online material.
But I have some advice as you start.
- Never copy paste, write all the lines on your own to practice

Ideally, you should have finished steps 1&2 this week, then I can share some basic material that you can read on your own. 
Then we can do some examples and you can practice on your own.
